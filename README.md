# Plotly Presentation

![Coverage Badge](docs/coverage.svg)

This repository is targeted data analysts building most of their analyses in python and exporting the graphs to a slide deck. 

## Inspiration
Most of the inspiration for the library is taken from the [Spotify Chartify](https://github.com/spotify/chartify) library.
Much of the callout inspiration is taken from think-cell.

## Adjusting the default to your preferences
Make a copy of the `_defaults` folder to your home folder and name it `.plotly_presentation` so the path name will be `~/.plotly_presentation/`.
Alternatively you can paste the folder to a destination of your choice and do the following command: `export PLOTLY_CONFIG_DIR=your_folder`.
